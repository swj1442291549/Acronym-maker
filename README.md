# acronym-maker

Help to make a catchy acronym for your project.


The word dictionary is adopted from (the top 100,000 most frequently-used English words)[https://gist.github.com/h3xx/1976236].


## Usage
Just input the keywords of your projects and the acronym would be generated based on the first letter of each keyword.

It will try all the possible permutations and may add a few extra letters to make it an acronym (you need to come up with their meanings yourself).

If you want to use multiple letters from a single keyword, just capitalize on these letters. This trick can also be useful if you want to preserve the order of specific keywords.

You can also add a question mark at the end of the keyword to indicate it's not compulsory.
